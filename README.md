## Description: 
####Created a Battleship game. Created this by using a class called ShipGame that allows two
#### people to play the game. Each player has their own 10x10 grid they place their ships on. On their turn, they can
#### fire a torpedo at a square on the enemy's grid. Player 'first' gets the first turn to fire a torpedo, after which
#### players alternate firing torpedoes. A ship is sunk when all of its squares have been hit. When a player sinks their
#### opponent's final ship, they win.
